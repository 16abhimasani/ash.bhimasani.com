        . I was supervised by Dr. Youngmoo Kim and the other Drexel STAR
        Scholars bouncing between projects to get a holistic experience with
        various advanced technologies including robotics, computer vision, smart
        fabrics, and digital signal processing.

        The first project I worked on was called Dancing Drones. The basic idea
        was to choreograph a team of Parrot AR Drones to fly autonomously with
        each other in-sync to music. The STAR scholars working on the project
        setup cameras around the room to create a 3D environment to control the
        bots. The best part of this project was actually dicussing with the
        students some of the fundamentals problems they had to deal with. One
        vivid example was dealing with the AC air flow in the building

        After this, I worked on the Humanoid Robot project (HUBO) as a
        collaboration between Drexel, MIT, Penn, and KAIST. For this project, I
        used MAESTOR, a ROS-based software interface that controls the robot‚Äôs
        movement and simulation. ROS was incredibly difficult to work with but
        after diving in I was able to control the HUBO‚Äôs movement at a basic
        level. Because of my experience in 3D printing, I mostly stuck to tuning
        the on-sight printer and replacing damaged/obsolete parts on the robot.
        Another project I worked on involved digital signal processing with Max
        MSP. My goal was to intake the digital output of Drexel‚Äôs Magnetic
        Resonator Piano (MRP) and create a light show that was coordinated to
        the keys, pitch, and vibrato played. The light would display as a LED
        strip over the keyboard. MSP was also tough to learn and incredibly
        frustrating in the beginning as I already had experience with Ableton
        and found the interface familiar but daunting in terms of functionality.
        MSP really allows you to manipulate every part of the signal which
        became more and more fun as I went along the project. Overall, the
        entire internship was immensely helpful and helped me develop my
        technical skills in software through advanced projects.
