        Hereâ€™s the desktop equivalent of the last 2 posts I made starting with
        Onboarding. More than a year ago, a lot of my attention was drawn to
        minimal interfaces. The wide whitespace and the centered grouping was an
        appealing idea; I wanted the fields in questions to be the main focal
        point of the whole experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large takeaway I think for form design and scalable interfaces in
        general is to assume you will probably need to scroll. As you can see
        here, we are pinning UI elements to corners and edges of the screen
        while centering all of our main content. Additionally, things not being
        in view when scrolling or typing seems to be an ever present problem
        that can be minimized by simply adding background and foreground.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have learned an incredible amount over the last year by listening to
        our userâ€™s feedback. While people enjoyed looking at the minimum fields
        per step; they perceived the overall experience as longer. Simply
        optimizing for a browserâ€™s autofill will do wonders to an experience (1
        click login / sign up seems pretty good ðŸ˜Ž).

        The work to optimize the hop from crypto to store credit to redemption
        began several years ago in the BitPay Wallet where the emphasis was on
        in-app or in-store redemption.

        Now with a desktop browser extension, we had a chance to do something
        similar with directly integrated merchants.
