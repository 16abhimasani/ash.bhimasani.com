            working on the gift card product about 3 years ago and we finally
            had a chance to build it.

            We think growing adoption means creatively utilizing existing
            systems. With the possibility of fluid-denomination gift cards, we
            sensed an opportunity to redefine one of the most private forms of
            payment available with a slick interface that just works.

            Like I mentioned previously, the idea for this app has been floated
            internally for quite some time. Last year I created BitPay's first

            of our partners and integrations. This was in effort to make it
            easier for people to discover brands and find out how to use crypto.
            Over the last year, the "Merchant Directory" has been gaining a lot
            more traction with our partners. Naturally we were looking for ways
            to take the concept to the next level.

            What if you could be prompted automatically during checkout to use

            An extension seemed like the next obvious step to supercharge our
            gift card service and promote brand discovery. We already sold gift
            cards in our mobile wallet for a few years now but we needed to
            bring this capability to the desktop. With the recent acquisition of

            After some initial discussion amongst the team, we were off to the
            races. Over the course of a month, I designed the entire experience
            end-to-end using a variety of principles we learned from previous
            projects. You can find extended breakdowns of the design process and
