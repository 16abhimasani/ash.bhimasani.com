        I'm really excited to share the latest project we've been working on;
        this project was a concept brainstormed amongst engineers working on the
        gift card program about 3 years ago and we finally had a chance to build
        it.

        We created a browser extension that seamlessly plugs into your checkout
        experience as you shop. Either alerting you of direct crypto acceptance
        or ability to purchase store credit.
      </p>
      <p>With a few clicks while on Amazon, you can:</p>

        like our wallet. Your store credit codes live entirely in the app plus
        your personal information and transaction data is kept private from the
        merchant.

      <p>
        We think growing adoption means creatively utilizing existing systems.
        With the possibility of fluid-denomination gift cards, we sensed an
        opportunity to redefine one of the most private forms of payment
        available with a slick interface that just works.

        Like I mentioned previously, the idea for this app has been floated
        internally for quite some time. Last year I created BitPay's first
        public
        <Anchor
          content="directory"

        of our partners and integrations. This was in effort to make it easier
        for people to find out how to use their crypto. Over the last year, the
        Directory has been getting a lot more traction with our partners so
        naturally we were looking for ways to take the concept to the next
        level.

        What if you could be prompted automatically during checkout to use
        crypto?

        An extension seemed like the next obvious step to supercharge our gift
        card program and brand discovery. We already sold gift cards in our
        mobile wallet for a few years now but we needed to bring this capability
        to the desktop. With the recent acquisition of

        , we knew there was something here worth pursuing.

        After some initial discussion with
        <Anchor

          href="https://twitter.com/tonygallippi"
          spaceBefore

        , we were off to the races. Over the course of a month, I designed the
        entire experience end-to-end, making sure to get ample feedback from as
        many people as possible. Above this section, you can find extended
        breakdowns of every UI view and behavior present in the app.
