    <div className="lead end-section">
      We created a browser extension that seamlessly plugs into your checkout
      experience as you shop. Either alerting you of direct crypto acceptance or
      ability to purchase store credit.
      <br />
      <br />
      With a few clicks while on Amazon, you can:

      like our wallet. Your store credit codes live entirely in the app plus
      your personal information and transaction data is kept private from the
      merchant.
      <br />
      <br />
      We think growing adoption means creatively utilizing existing systems.
      With the possibility of fluid-denomination gift cards, we sensed an
      opportunity to redefine one of the most private forms of payment available
      with a slick interface that just works.

      Like I mentioned previously, the idea for this app has been floated
      internally for quite some time. Last year I created BitPay's first public
      <Anchor
        content="directory"

      of our partners and integrations. This was in effort to make it easier for
      people to find out how to use their crypto. Over the last year, the
      Directory has been getting a lot more traction with our partners so
      naturally we were looking for ways to take the concept to the next level.
      <blockquote>
        What if you could be prompted automatically during checkout to use
        crypto?
      </blockquote>
      An extension seemed like the next obvious step to supercharge our gift
      card program and brand discovery. We already sold gift cards within our
      mobile wallet but we needed to bring this capability to the desktop. With
      the recent acquisition of

      , we knew there was something here worthwhile.
      <br />

      After some initial discussion with

      />
      , we were off to the races. Over the course of a month, I designed the
      entire experience end-to-end, making sure to get ample feedback from as
      many people as possible. Above this section, you can find extended
      breakdowns present in the app.
