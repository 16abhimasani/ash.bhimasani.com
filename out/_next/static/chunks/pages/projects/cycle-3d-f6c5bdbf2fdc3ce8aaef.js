I decided to design the grinder to use a 2 step grinding process. The primary grinder section at the top intakes raw plastic (like water bottles) and shreds them at slow speeds, essentially tearing the material into manageable chunks. The secondary shredders are the second step of this process where the large chunks are reduced to smaller pieces through multiple shredders. The filter at the bottom allows pieces that are not small enough to be kicked back up into the shredders until uniform size is achieved.

I also decided to us a square axle so adhesives or fixtures wouldn\u2019t have to be used to keep the axle from rotating within the gear. The gears also have square cutouts for motor mounting or hand crank attachment. Instead of directly attaching the motors we have to the gears I wanted to use a square adaptor so any motor or a hand crank can be fitted.
